## üìù Article Content Tips

```

<p>Activating your freelancer account<br>Before you activate your freelancer account, make sure that the e-mail of your Fiverr account is correct.</p>

<p>If it is not correct, you can change your email or Contact Support for assistance.</p>
```

### Using HTML in Content (Advanced)

```html
<h2>Main Heading</h2>
<h3>Sub Heading</h3>

<p>Paragraph text goes here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bullet point 1</li>
  <li>Bullet point 2</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Numbered item 1</li>
  <li>Numbered item 2</li>
</ol>

<strong>Bold text</strong>
<em>Italic text</em>

<a href="https://www.fiverr.com" target="_blank">Link to Fiverr</a>

<blockquote>
  This is a quote or important callout
</blockquote>
```
